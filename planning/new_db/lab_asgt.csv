1,INTRO,Introduction to Reproducible Research,"This lab will introduce the principles of reproducible research and the tools we will use to perform the tasks of reproducible research.

During lab on <% wday(context$date, label = TRUE, abbr=FALSE) %>, you will set up a free account on GitHub, as described in ""[Introduction to Git and GitHub Classroom](/lab_docs/lab_01_git_intro/)."" After you sign up on GitHub will probably also want to register on GitHub as a student (<https://education.github.com/students>), to get a bunch of free extra features.",https://classroom.github.com/a/UNOxC36Q,INTRO_REPORT,NA,"Ordinarily, you should do the lab reading **_before_** you come to lab, but the first lab of the semester happens on the first day of class, so you will not have a chance to do this. Because of this, the first lab of the semester will consist of introducing you to the software tools we will be using for the semester, and you do not have to do any advance preparation. The material linked here is supplementary and you should read it during the week following the first lab.

Starting with the second lab session, on <% format_day_date_by_key(calendar, ""DATA"", ""lab"", abbr_month = FALSE, abbr_wday = FALSE) %>, you should both **do the reading** and **accept the GitHub classroom assignment** (this will be explained in the first lab session) _before_ you come to lab.",0,1
2,DATA,Working with climate data,"This lab will introduce working with climate data using R and RMarkdown. 

There are two parts to this lab assignment: 

1. Part 1 is more like traditional homework. It consists of several exercises from chapter 3 of _<% MEDIUM_ARCHER %>_, working with layer models of the greenhouse effect:
   * **All students** do Chapter 3, exercises 2--3.
   * **Graduate students** should also do Chapter 3, exercise 1.

     For the exercises, use the following numbers:

     * I~solar~ = 1350 W/m^2^
     * $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$
     * $\alpha = 0.30$
     * $\varepsilon = 1.0$

     For Part 1, you have a choice of either working it like traditional homework on paper or else doing it with RMarkdown, using an RMarkdown template in the repository for the assignment.
     If you do it in Rmarkdown, you will use the template file I provided and fill in the R code to do the calculations and then use RMarkdown to include the answers in the text of the document.

2. For part 2, you will practice using R to organize and analyze data on the climate. We will download temperature and CO~2~ measurements from scientific archives of climate data and practice producing tables of measurements, making plots of the measurements, and analyzing the series of measurements to determine the trends over time (rates of increase or decrease).

Both parts of the lab are due by the beginning of class on Friday, Jan. 24. If you do the layer model exercises on paper, turn in your work at the beginning of class. If you do the exercises with RMarkdown, knit your document to PDF or Word format and push it to GitHub. For Part 2, you must knit your work into a PDF or Word document and push the result to GitHub.

## Reminder:

**To turn in your RMarkdown homework you need to complete three steps:""**

1. Successfully **knit** `Lab_02_assignment_part_2.Rmd` into a `.pdf` or 
   Word (`.docx`) file. 
   
     If you choose to do Part 1 in RMarkdown instead 
     of on paper, also knit `Lab_02_assignment_part_1.Rmd`. Otherwise you will
     turn in Part 1 on paper at the beginning of class on Friday Jan. 24.
2. **Commit** your `.Rmd` (rmarkdown) document **and** the `.pdf` or `.docx` 
   file to your local git repository on your computer.
3. **Push** your local repository to GitHub, so Ms. Best and Prof. Gilligan 
   can see your final results.

**The last version of your work that you have pushed by the deadline is what will be graded.**
You will lose a lot of points if there is not a `.pdf` or `.docx` file with results.

As long as there is a file with results, we will be generous with partial credit.

3,MODTRAN,Infrared light in the atmosphere,"This lab will use the MODTRAN computer model to simulate the transmission of different wavelengths of infrared light through the atmosphere and explore the effect that different greenhouse gases have on infrared light and the earth's temperature.

There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading `Lab_03_instructions.pdf`, which describes things you need
to know for this lab (about the R functions for working with the MODTRAN model
and the data that it produces, as well as some useful R functions that we will
use in procesing and graphing data for this lab.)

This file also has the exercises you will do for this lab.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
edit the file `Lab_03_exercises.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
work.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `Lab_03_data_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

    The last changes that you push before the due date 
    (9:00 AM on <% format_day_date_by_key(calendar, ""MODTRAN_REPORT"", ""due date"") %>) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they 
knit correctly.

12,ROLE_PLAY,Role-Playing Emissions Regulations,"This week, we will do something very different. We will role-play different kinds of greenhouse gas emissions regulations: 

* ""**Command-and-Control**,"" in which the EPA mandates the maximum emissions for each company, 
* ""**Cap and Trade**,"" in which the EPA mandates the total emissions, and gives each company a certain number of permits, but the companies can buy and sell permits,
* ""**Emissions Tax**,"" in which the EPA imposes a tax on each ton of emissions, and then reduces other taxes to keep the total government revenue constant.

Students will play different roles: some will act as government regulators at the Environmental Protection Agency and others will act as managers of different companies that must balance their desire to make money against the environmental damage from the pollution they emit.

There is no report to complete for this lab, but there is a short homework assignment in preparation for the lab. The homework will be due when you come to lab on <% wday(get_date_by_key(calendar, ""ROLE_PLAY"", ""lab""), label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE) %>.

13,DECARB_PROJECT,Group Project: Decarbonization Policy for a Country,"You and a partner will pick a country and begin working on a policy analysis for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.

## Important Update

The original assignment said to analyze **both** the 2030 goal for the Paris nationally determined contribution **and** the 2050 goal that you choose. 

I have decided that is too much work, so you should **only** do the analysis of how the country would achieve the **2050** goal that you choose (you **do not** have to analyze the difficulty of meeting the 2030 goal).",NA,DECARB_PROJECT_REPORT,DECARB_PROJECT_PRESENTATIONS,NA,0,1
