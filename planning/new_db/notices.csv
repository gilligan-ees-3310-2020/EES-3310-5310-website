INTRO_CLIMATE_CHANGE,class,What is Climate Change?,"**Correction:** There was a typo in the original version of this assignment sheet.
The reading from _Climate Casio_ for Wednesday Jan. 8 should have been 
chapters 1--2, not chapters 2--3. We will read chapter 3 later in the semester
when we discuss climate modeling, so you will not have wasted your effort,
but I wanted to issue this clarification about the error in the original 
assignment, and to clear up confusion since the reading notes discussed chapters
1--2.
