# Overview:

Everyone is feeling a lot of stress and fatigue at this point in the semester, so I have decided to give everyone a week off from new lab assignments.

Starting next week, you will start an independent lab project where you will spend a couple of weeks developing an independent project to look at a new question about climate science. This question can involve looking more deeply into something that you studied in a previous lab, or it can be something new.
