# Overview:

You will use the Kaya identity to analyze challenges to decarbonizing the world's energy supply, following the "bottom-up" approach that we read about in The Climate Fix.

I have posted a revised version of the lab instructions here. These don't change the assignment at all, but they correct the typos that I announced in lab on Monday about section 6.
