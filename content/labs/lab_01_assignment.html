<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>This lab will introduce the principles of reproducible research and the tools we will use to perform the tasks of reproducible research.</p>
<p>During lab on Monday, you will set up a free account on GitHub, as described in “<a href="/lab_docs/lab_01_git_intro/">Introduction to Git and GitHub Classroom</a>.” After you sign up on GitHub will probably also want to register on GitHub as a student (<a href="https://education.github.com/students" class="uri">https://education.github.com/students</a>), to get a bunch of free extra features.</p>
<div id="reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Ordinarily, you should do the lab reading <strong><em>before</em></strong> you come to lab, but the first lab of the semester happens on the first day of class, so you will not have a chance to do this. Because of this, the first lab of the semester will consist of introducing you to the software tools we will be using for the semester, and you do not have to do any advance preparation. The material linked here is supplementary and you should read it during the week following the first lab.</p>
<p>Starting with the second lab session, on Monday, January 13, you should both <strong>do the reading</strong> and <strong>accept the GitHub classroom assignment</strong> (this will be explained in the first lab session) <em>before</em> you come to lab.</p>
