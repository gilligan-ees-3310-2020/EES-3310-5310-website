<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>You and a partner will pick a country and begin working on a policy analysis for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<div id="important-update" class="section level2">
<h2>Important Update</h2>
<p>The original assignment said to analyze <strong>both</strong> the 2030 goal for the Paris nationally determined contribution <strong>and</strong> the 2050 goal that you choose.</p>
<p>I have decided that is too much work, so you should <strong>only</strong> do the analysis of how the country would achieve the <strong>2050</strong> goal that you choose (you <strong>do not</strong> have to analyze the difficulty of meeting the 2030 goal).</p>
