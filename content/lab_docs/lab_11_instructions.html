<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will use a top-down approach to figure out how much new energy
infrastructure you would need to install for the country you analyzed in
the bottom-up lab, in order to meet the emissions-reduction goals
for 2050.</p>
<p>You will analyze the same country you did in the bottom-up lab last
week, from the options of
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, or United Kingdom.</p>

<div id="outline" class="section level2">
<h2>Outline:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For your country, examine the top-down projections for the Kaya
variables for the year 2050. How many quads of energy does the
Energy Information Administration preduct that the country will use
in 2050?</p></li>
<li><p>Examine the mix of energy sources that the country used in 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>If the country uses the same percentages of each energy source in
2050 that it did in 2018,
calculate how much energy the country would use from each energy source in
2050 and how much CO<sub>2</sub> each energy source would emit.
Add these up to get the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <em>F</em> in 2050 under a
“business-as-usual” scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the policy target for <em>F</em> in the year 2050.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate how much the country would have to reduce its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in
2050 below business-as-usual to meet its policy goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocate the emissions reduction from step 5 across the different fuels and
calculate the amount of fossil fuel energy the country would need to replace
with clean energy by 2050 to meet its policy goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate how many clean power plants the country would need to build
between now and 2050 to produce this clean energy.</p>
<p>Report this as the total number, the number per year, and the number per
week or per day if appropriate.</p>
<p>Start by doing this calculation for nuclear energy plants, then repeat the
calculation for solar, and then for wind.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead that the country supplied its growing energy
demand with coal. Calculate how many new coal power plants it would have
to build between now and 2050 to supply the growing energy
demand.</p>
<p>Calculate the number of new coal power plants the country would have to
build and how much additional CO<sub>2</sub> that would put into the atmosphere
every year.</p></li>

<h2>Detailed Instructions:</h2>
<p>For each country:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Use the function <code>project_top_down()</code> from the
<code>kayadata</code> package to examine the top-down projections for the Kaya
variables for the year 2050. How many quads of energy does the
Energy Information Administration preduct that the country will use
in 2050?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>get_fuel_mix()</code> function to get the mix of energy sources that the
country used in 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>If the country uses the same percentages of each energy source in
2050 that it did in 2018, calculate the number of
quads and the greenhouse gas emissions from each energy source
in 2050, if the total energy consumed in that year
is the value for <em>E</em> that you looked up in step (1).</p>
<p>First, multiply the total energy demand <em>E</em> in 2050 by the
percentages in the fuel mix to get the number of quads for that energy
source. Then multiply the number of quads for each energy source by the
emissions factor for that fuel to get the emissions from that energy
source.</p>
<p>Finally, add up the emissions from all of the fuel sources to get the total
emissions for 2050, under a “business-as-usual” scenario, where
the mix of energy sources does not change.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can combine data frames using <code>join</code> functions to make this
easier. Here is an example, which I have worked for France. You can
do the same thing for other countries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>E_2050 &lt;- get_top_down_values(&quot;France&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 2050) %$% E
fm &lt;- get_fuel_mix(&quot;France&quot;)
# Calculate the mix of energy sources for 2050
fm_2050 &lt;- fm %&gt;% mutate(quads = E_2050 * frac)
kable(fm, digits = 2)</code></pre>

<li><p>Get the Kaya identity data for the country from <code>get_kaya_data()</code> and look
up the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <em>F</em> in 2005. Then use the policy goal for
emissions reduction from the data frame <code>rcp_26</code> to calculate the policy
target for <em>F</em> in the year 2050. You did this calculation last
week as part of the bottom-up analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the projected “business as usual” emissions from step (3) to the
policy target from step (4) to figure the total amount of emissions you
would need to cut by converting fossil fuel energy sources to clean sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the top-down procedure I presented in class last week to allocate the
emissions reduction that you calculated in step (5) across the different
energy sources for 2050, that you calculated in step (3).</p>
<p>How many million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> would you cut from coal, natural gas,
and oil? How many quads of energy from that fuel would you need to replace
with new clean energy?</p>
<p>Add up all of the clean energy requirements to calculate the number of quads
of clean energy that the country would need to add between now and
2050 to meet the policy goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate how many clean generating plants you would need to build between
now and 2050 to produce this clean energy. Report this as the
total number, the number per year, and the number per week or per day if
the number is large.</p>
<p>Start with nuclear, then do the calculation for solar and then for wind.</p>
<p>You can look up the nameplate capacity and the capacity factor for
different kinds of power plants (clean and dirty) from the function
<code>generating_capacity()</code>.<br />
Remember that the average number of megawatts a power source supplies over
a year is the nameplate capacity times the capacity factor.
Remember that one quad equals
11,000 megawatts.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead that the country supplied its growing energy
demand with coal. Calculate how many new coal power plants it would have
to build between now and 2050 to supply the growing energy
demand.</p>
<p>Calculate the number of new coal power plants the country would have to
