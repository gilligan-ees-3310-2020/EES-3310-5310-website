## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Understanding the Forecast, Ch. 11, pp. 135--145.

### Reading Notes:

* The last hundred years: Focus on two things in particular:

    1. What is the evidence that the planet has warmed significantly in the last century?
    1. What is the evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible?

* The last thousand years: This gets into some very tricky and controversial material that was central to the infamous "climategate" scandal in 2009. I will not spend a huge amount of time on this, but I will attempt to explain in class what the controversy was about and why it isn't nearly as big a deal as the media have made it out to be.

    Some things to understand about the past millennium are:

    * What is a **proxy** for ancient temperatures? What are examples of commonly used proxies?
    * What problems do scientists face trying to get past temperatures from proxies?
    * What were the **Medieval Warm Period** and the **Little Ice Age**? Roughly when did they happen? What are the big questions scientists have about them?
