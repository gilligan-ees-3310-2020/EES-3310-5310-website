<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>The midterm exam will be a mixture of about 40% multiple-choice questions and 60% free-response short-answer questions.
It will cover all the reading through Monday, Mar.Â 1.</p>
<p>I will provide a sheet with the important numbers (such as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the lapse rate of the atmosphere,
the solar constant, and so forth), and the important equations (such as the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the barometric law,
and the chemical reactions that control carbon-dioxide buffering in the oceans).</p>
<p>Remember to bring a calculator, #2 pencils, and an eraser.</p>
